*Project from 42's Common Core, finished with @jecointr in June 2023.*

# miniRT
Second project using the *MiniLibX* graphical library. This is a Raytracer able to render scenes with simple geometric objects (spheres, planes and cylinders) and with ambient & spot lighting.

Compile with `make` and execute by passing a scene as argument (demo scenes can be found in `/scenes/`).
